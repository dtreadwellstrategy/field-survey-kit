      <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
      Thank you for participating in this crowdsourced mapping initiative. The purpose of this platform is to collect accurate field-level geospatial data related to environmental, agricultural, and infrastructural assessments. Your participation directly supports efforts in sustainable development, environmental monitoring, and field-based research through user-informed reporting.
      This platform is designed to empower communities and field researchers to better understand geographic conditions and resource usage across diverse regions. 
      Participation in this initiative is voluntary. By continuing, you acknowledge that you are contributing to a shared resource intended for research, planning, and analytic applications. Please review the following terms carefully before proceeding.</p>

      <p><strong>1. Authorized Use Only</strong><br>
      This web-based tool is intended solely for approved users who are contributing observational or location-based data for legitimate research purposes. Unauthorized use, reverse engineering, or replication of the platform is strictly prohibited.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Data Collected</strong><br>

      <ul>
        <li>Geospatial analysis and visualization</li>
        <li>AI model training and development</li>
        <li>Research publications and internal reporting</li>
        <li>Aggregated datasets shared with trusted partners</li>
      </ul>
      No personally identifiable information will be published or sold. Data may be retained indefinitely for longitudinal study.</p>
